# Influence of Political Ads in the 2016 presidential elections

The goal of this project was to perform an in-depth analysis of the political ads aired during the 2016 US presidential election and their outcomes. I used a combination of pandas, sql and numpy for data collection, cleaning and analysis. Finally the visualizations were done in Tableau.
