# Influence of Political Ads in the 2016 presidential elections

The goal of this project was to perform an in-depth analysis of the political ads aired during the 2016 US presidential election and their outcomes. I used a combination of pandas, sql and numpy for data collection, cleaning and analysis. Finally the visualizations were done in Tableau.

## Code files

__ads_data_cleanup.ipynb__ - cleanup of the tv ads dataset obtained from politicaladsarchive.org

__2016_us_president_votes.sql, tv_ads_votes.sql__ - extraction of relevant data from the tv ads and the votes data from the 2016 us presidential elections

__ads_analysis.ipynb__ - analysis of the cleaned data and extracting relevant information for plots in Tableau

## Remarks

A detailed discussion of the analysis and the results are available at https://karthik-arumugam.medium.com/political-ads-in-the-2016-us-presidential-elections-d07925f16b34. I am unable to share the data files since almost all of them are above 100 Mb in size and Github has a very strict policy about file size. However, if you do need the data please feel free to leave me a message in the comments section under the medium article and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
